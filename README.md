# AGRITA
Shared App development 

Agricultural application with the idea of basic / easy data visualisation. 
Some features include:

1. Host profile with linked employee profiles that can read and edit files.
2. Daily/weekly contribution to new data
3. Cloud based storage
4. Compare data to previous month's / year's data
5. Personalise the lists to add/remove any fields
6. To-do lists with reminders (optional for user). Reminders will pop up daily/ half-daily until task has been completed.  

New addition ideas for cattle (all live stock):

7. Interactive tag ID. Each one will have a unique code where if the user clicks on said ID, data can be added to the unique ID. Each ID will provide unique data like year born, age, sex etc. 
8. "Dra krag" van velde. Werk uit met formule hoeveel beeste per ha. kan in die velde wei asook tips itv. timing om beeste te rotate van veld tot veld gebaseer op weer patrone (gaan dit reen? los veld dan nog bietjie vir recovery etc). 

Future features include:

1. Field mapping 
2. Tracking of live stock in fields (manual input) 

Write basic program that summarises the data. If this works, start expanding to mmore advanced features.
When the basic program has been created, start with the front end design. 
Create a clean and easy to use design.
